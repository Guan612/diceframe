"""Read-only projection contracts for canonical content.

Content projection is an application/read boundary.  A projector may combine
canonical content with already-resolved view context, but it must return a new
mapping and must not mutate the authority it received.  The broad contract is
kept deliberately small here; the domain-specific ``ContentProjectionService``
belongs to the later projection cutover (Track C PR D).
