"""Who may change which field of a classic (non rules-aware) character sheet.

The browser is never the authority over mechanics (ARCHITECTURE §server
authority): HP, balance, resources, progression, inventory and the numbers
checks are rolled against are owned by the engine (state changes, progression
resolver, economy) and by the GM.  A seated player, a bot acting for a seat
and a P2P guest relayed by the host may only edit how the character is
presented.  The one mechanical change a player makes on a classic sheet is
spending level-up points the engine granted, which is validated here.

Rules-aware rulesets (``character_lifecycle == "rules_aware"``) never reach
this policy: their generic PUT is refused and they use their own profile /
advancement / rest endpoints.
