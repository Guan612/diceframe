"""The D&D 2024 class feature boundary.

One module answers "what does this character actually have": its class, its
class level, the class features it owns, their simple scalar parameters, its
class resource maxima, and the combat capabilities it may declare right now.

It never mutates state, never resolves dice, and never touches CombatState.
Callers (combat, view, projection, frontend payloads) ask this boundary instead
of each re-parsing the class level for themselves.
