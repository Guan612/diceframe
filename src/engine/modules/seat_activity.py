"""Which seats have acted in the current run (persisted module slot).

A seat "has acted" once it declared an action for a round (queued or
deferred) while played for its player (see ``plays_for_its_player``), had a
player-side rules-aware intent applied for it, or spent luck on its own check.
Saves from before this slot existed are seeded by the v40 -> v41 instance
migration.  The flag gates
player-side sheet resets: after a seat acted, only the GM may apply a library
card to it or delete it, so a player cannot refill / re-roll a character that
is already in play (directly, or by deleting it and joining again).

Why a dedicated slot instead of reading the log: the log is persisted only as
its last 100 rounds, a seat may idle for many rounds, and rules-aware combat
resolves intents outside the narrative log.  The flag belongs to the run, like
the log: a new run (restart / reset) starts with no seat having acted, and a
removed seat drops its flag.  It is monotonic within a run (a historical
rewrite does not clear it), which errs on the side of the GM.
