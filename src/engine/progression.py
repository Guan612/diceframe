"""Single owner of runtime round-counter writes (Track R5-a).

Callers own locks and transaction boundaries. Each writer preserves its
original expression, including coercion (or its absence) and evaluation order.
Readers use ``current_round`` here or ``progression_state.round_value``;
settlement eras remain narrative rounds (ADR-0003). Module-backed instances
read and write the progression slot through ``progression_state`` and reject
unknown schemas/modes before writes. Standalone round-bearing objects retain
the R5-a contract; absence of a module container does not invent one.
