"""Lifecycle hooks capability modules register to join the core game flow (#515).

The core flow calls a hook point; it never names the module behind it.  A
point with no registered handler is a no-op (``run``) or answers with the
caller's default (``ask``), so deleting a capability module leaves a playable
game that only lacks that capability.

Hook points are a closed set: registering an unknown point is an error, so a
typo cannot silently detach a module.  Handlers run in registration order.
This registry must not import GameInstance or any concrete module.
