"""Product contract: in D&D 2024 combat the party sees enemies' exact HP.

The authoritative ``ruleset_state["combat"]`` projection gives every seated
viewer (not only the GM) each enemy's current and maximum HP, while the actor
roster stays a presentation view: enemy stat-block internals (attacks,
abilities, saving throws) are not part of it, and a visitor without a seat
gets nothing.  The P2P bridge relays ``/available-actions`` to this same HTTP
route as the guest's own identity, so it inherits this projection unchanged.
